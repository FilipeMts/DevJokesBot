# DevJokes - a Discord Bot

This a very simple Discord bot built with NodeJS that returns a random joke about programming / developers.

The DevJokesBot is live at this [Discord server](https://discord.gg/vm2jNa2). You can interact with it by typing the “!joke” command (without quotation marks) on the main channel or by DM.

Jokes are fetched from the [Official Joke API]( https://github.com/15Dkatz/official_joke_api).
